a[-1]    # last item in the array
a[-2:]   # last two items in the array
a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items
a[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed
a[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed
a[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed
a[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed

Python find() method finds substring in the whole string and returns index of the first match.
It returns -1 if substring does not match.

>>> 'abcdefghijklm'[2:10:3]  # start at 2, go upto 10, count by 3
'cfi'
>>> 'abcdefghijklm'[10:2:-1] # start at 10, go downto 2, count down by 1
'kjihgfed'

If the start and stop aren't specified, it means to go through the entire sequence:

>>> 'abcdefghijklm'[::3]  # beginning to end, counting by 3
'adgjm'
>>> 'abcdefghijklm'[::-3] # end to beginning, counting down by 3
'mjgda'
